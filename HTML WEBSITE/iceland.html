    <p style="color: white;">The best view of the auroras is from Kirkjufell mountain on the west coast. In high activity you
        can even spy the northern lights from the suburbs of Reykjav√≠k; the Grotta Lighthouse is a popular viewing spot.
        Across the country, sky watchers can take in the dancing lights from outdoor hot tubs, 
        inside Buubble lodges, and from hot spring lagoons.</p>
