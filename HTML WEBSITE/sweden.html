        Sweden’s northernmost town of Kiruna is a gateway for nearby attractions. 
        There is the ICEHOTEL, mountainous Abisko National Park, the local Sami culture,
         and plentiful reindeer. A short drive from the town takes you to a good spot for aurora viewing. 
         The weather here is much more stable than the Norwegian coast, but it’s colder too.
        In Finland’s Lapland region, Rovaniemi serves as a gateway town to nearby national 
        parks—where in winter you can spot frozen snow-covered trees called Tykky sculptures along with the northern lights.</p>
