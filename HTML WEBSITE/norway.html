    <p style="color: white;">
        The largest urban area in northern Norway is 217 miles north of the Arctic Circle, but thanks to the Gulf Stream the 
        coastline has surprisingly moderate temperatures. It also has beautiful scenery, magnificent fjords, and the Lyngen Alps.
        I have seen spectacular auroras from the village of Ersfjordbotn, 12 miles from Tromsø. Other popular locations in
         the country are the Lofoten Islands and the far northern towns of Alta, ordkapp, and Kirkenes.</p>
