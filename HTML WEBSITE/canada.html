    <p style="color: white;">This Northwest Territories capital on the shores of 
        Great Slave Lake boasts its own Aurora Village and special activities for northern lights tourism.
        Canada is an aurora viewing paradise, thanks to its northern latitude and low light pollution; 
        elsewhere in the country, Wood Buffalo and Jasper National Park are popular viewing spots.        
        </p>
    <strong style="color: white;">When to Go: Mid-August to late April. For Churchill and Wood Buffalo, early August to early May.</strong>
